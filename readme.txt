The HashTraffic WordPress plugin enables hashtags on WordPress pages and blog posts.

== Description ==

The HashTraffic WordPress plugin enables hashtags on WordPress pages and blog posts.

Clicking a hashtag loads an overlay modal window with a hashtag search results page that includes Web pages, Google+ updates, Instagram photos and Twitter hashtag matches.

The WordPress author's posts and pages will appear globally (on other people's WordPress sites) in the hashtag search results when pages or posts use hashtags.
